# Job-Portal
Developed a job portal using React.js with Chakra UI on the frontend, alongside Axios, React Router DOM, and Redux for state management. The backend is built with Express.js and Mongoose, implementing JWT for authentication, with error handling through async handlers and middleware. The portal allows users to search, apply for jobs, and manage their applications efficiently.
